        <p><strong>Albert Einstein</strong> was a German-born theoretical physicist. He developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics. Einstein's work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. Einstein is
          best known in popular culture for his mass-energy equivalence formula. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric
          effect, a pivotal step in the evolution of quantum theory.</p>

        <h3><div class="year">1884</div>Mystery of Magnetism</h3>
        <p>At the age of five, Albert Einstein becomes fascinated by his father's pocket compass, intrigued by invisible forces that cause the needle always to point north. Later in life, Einstein will look back at this moment as the genesis of his interest
          in science.</p>

        <p>Struggling financially, the Einstein family moves from Germany to Italy in search of better work. Albert, aged fifteen, stays behind in Munich to finish his schooling, but soon either quits or is kicked out of his high school and follows his parents
          to Italy.</p>

          a groundbreaking new interpretation of the photoelectric effect as well as the first published exploration of the theory of Special Relativity and the first formulation of the famous equation <code>E = mc<sup>2</sup></code>.</p>
